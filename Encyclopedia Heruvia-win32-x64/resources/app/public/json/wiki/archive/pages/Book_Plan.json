Each book has particular seasonal geographical themes, as well as seasonal fauna and flora.</li><li>Summer Geograhy: Deserts</li><li>Summer Ecology: Reptilies and insects, Shrubs and branches</li><li>Autumn Geography: Marshes and Forests</li><li>Autumn Ecology: Deer-like and Rodents, Mosses and weeds</li><li>Winter Geography: Ice &amp; Water</li><li>Winter Ecology: Bear-like and aquatic, berries and thorns</li><li>Spring Geography: Fields and Clouds</li><li>Spring Ecology: Wolf-like and bird-like, grasses and flowers</li><li>The four main characters are: Junka, Floke, Ekkir, and Klara.</li><li>Black eyes with white flecks like the universe is a sign of \"oneness\" with the Spirits, like Heru, the Goatman etc</li></ul><h1>Book 2: Beyond the Hollow Mountain</h1><h2>General Plot</h2><ul><li>There has been \"an awakening\" and many of the old myths and tales are proving to be true as the beasts, creatures, and beings come out of hibernation.</li><li>Description of Mutasaih now that it is ruled by the Dakkharen.</li><li>The Temple of Mutasaih has now branched off from the Temple Collective, who still adhere to the Ussurian Spiritual Cannon, whereas Kharron's Temple has a \"darker\"/stoner doom style vibe. Kharron teaches Junka the language of the Northern Realm.</li><li>Junka travels to the Hollow Mountain to visit Fenraye's Tomb and recover the remaining documents that Fenraye left behind. However, when he gets there he finds it empty.</li><li>An unknown entity has got there first, taking with them the documnts. This is the New Ruler, who has taken up the title of Mant. The New Ruler is in the process of translating Fenraye's documents and learning their teachings. Because the Spirits are unknown/villainised in the Northern Realm, he is able to use his evolving knowledge to expand his rule, claiming his powers to be divinity rather than by the grace of the Spirits.</li><li>Upon leaving the Hollow Mountain, the Gargoyle reveals himself and tells Junka he knows where the person went who took what Junka was looking for.</li><li>They travel to the North, and Junka seeks shelter in an old dolmen ruin. When he wakes up, he is surrounded by Forest People. Use reference to \"Houge\", Old Norse <em>haugr</em>, for its name, meaning mound or barrow, and taken to the Otameng.</li><li>Junka is accused of being a heaten in a Northern City, and is taken to an Icelandic style \"thing\". The Gargoyle uses his smooth tongue to convince people to let him free. <em>\"Forever am I shunned for my appearance, but my words are more beautiful than my face. I represent all that is ugly in humanity - not by the form of my body, but by the reactions I receive from others\".</em></li><li>Klara Saves Ekkir from the Gorjon prison, who is now emaciated. Ekkir wants to make Earthman-like guns.</li><li>The Gargoyle convinces the New Ruler's retarded brother to kill him - turns out the New Ruler initially wanted to learn of Fenraye's teachings to cure his brother, but the power corrupted him.</li><li>Klara begins to show ambition to take over control in Ussur, and perhaps does so by the end of the book - she wants to use her control of the city's resources to build a machine that could save the planet, and wants Ekkir to help her achieve it, hence why she frees him, although he is hated by many and can only be revealed to be free once Klara has power and can reject that he is still their prisoner. Ekkir insists he is still Warden of Mutasaih by right, but the Dakkharen disregard him and Klara insists that he stays in Ussur. Klara faces resistence initially when she proposes that she works on Earthmen tech - there isn't enough money to go into funding and industry</li></ul><h2>Potential Ideas</h2><ul><li>An ancient battlefield where thousands swords stick out of the ground, but are so rusted that they disintegrate at the lightest touch. Remenance of old battle during War of the Beasts. People of the North avoid these lands because they believe monsters still inhabit them.</li><li>Ruins of old Astanan buildings.</li><li>The Northern Realm call the Spirits \"pouques\" (or similar, means faries), although they do not know much about them, for they consider it \"black magic\" or \"voodoo\".</li><li>Include menhirs and monoliths, relics of Astana: Singing menhirs when the wind blows.</li><li>Junka keeps meeting men with the same face, eventually revealed to be the New Ruler.</li><li>Trees in the forest that look like men - The Otameng turned corrupted men (Dommafall) who attacked the forest into trees.</li><li>The New Ruler has Mant Kuþo's sword.</li><li>Conflict between \"feifdoms\" in the Northern Realm allows the New Ruler to quickly gain power amidst the unrest.</li><li>Junka stays in the castle of one of the feifdoms he visits on his journey. The \"king\" has two wives: \"wives in name, husband he is not\". The King and his wives explain the threat of the New Ruler.</li><li>Mushrooms that allow Forest People to see other Life Seed locations.</li><li>A man with his faced wrapped in a black cloth, for he is blind and (apparently) hideously ugly, according to the New Ruler, but is a great fighter for the New Ruler. In a one on one battle he is killed, and the \"victor\" removes the cloth to seehis face. He is as beautiful as an angel.</li><li>Floke's stablemaster becomes her confidant.</li><li>Forest \"sear\" with antlers surgically fixed to his head.</li><li>Floke enters the 'forbidden library' and discovers that the High Priestess knew of that Mants and a bit about how they became corrupted. This lead her to keep some of the knowledge of the spirits secret so that the knowledge didn't get into the wrong hands. This is why she condemned kharrons behaviour but could never explicitly say why.</li><li>The Gargoyle uses Junka's poor language against him to go against him without Junka realising.</li><li>Junka sees a burning village, attacked by the New Ruler's invaders, who use the mantra \"The Wind of our Voices, The Thunder of our Footsteps, and the Flames of our Torches\", referring to the old Mants and how the New Ruler is as powerful as the three combined.</li><li>Junka walks into ancient Temple where the are depictions of Baskilla and Gargoyles on the wall (perhaps Astanan in origin), which forces the Gargoyle to reveal some of its history (but without incriminating itself).</li><li>Ekkir, with his enw found gun technology, creates a following to take a city.</li><li>Forest people leader has open beating heart (covered most of the time by a bed of herbal leaves) and antlers surgically attached to his head/skull</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Key Points</h2><ul><li>The Gargoyle is very cunning, sly-tongued, and witty. He speaks largely in poetic verse, or in an archaic style. He is one of the rejected Gargoyles branded with the horns of betrayal upon its back. He is ultimately doing what he can to gain favour with the Baskilla, Dommahound, and other Gargoyles by destroying the Ermans, and is secretely desperate to be re-accepted by them. The New Ruler simply poses a threat to the Dommahound whilst they are recovering their strength. So the Gargoyle is 1) tricking Junka into believing he is helping Junka (need reason why), then 2) tricking Junka by leading him to the New Ruler, 3) tricks the New Ruler by pretending to have found a Heightentee to give to the New Ruler as a reward so that it might gain favour with him, 4) Helps destroy the New Ruler, making Junka think that perhaps the Gargoyle is good after all, however 5) the Gargoyle tricks Junka into journeying to the Ermans to uncover more truths about the Spirits...</li><li>The land after the Vovosian Range and the main Northern feifdoms is considered cursed, and many do not travel through it due to the stories of the War of the Beasts and because of the neolithic-style Forest People who are known to capture and kill travellers. Some of the Forest People know the common tongue after learning it from travellers.</li><li>New Ruler wants to abolish all other religions and include himself in the old Pantheon of Deities, claiming that he is a child of some of them. (Reference to Egyptian pharoes inserting themselves into the Panteon). He also wants to take the Inditt Region too after his conquest of the North.</li><li>Klara gives Ekkir anti-aging \"potions\" so that they live as long as Junka (envigorated by the Spirits) and herself (so that they remain \"youthful\" through the four seasons\"). Floke meanwhile grows old and bitter, spending her life trying to overthrow Klara.</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Stylistic</h2><ul><li>The Forest People call their people \"Children of Summer\", whilst their children are called \"Children of Autumn\", and they say that they will grow big and strong.</li><li>The further out from the New Ruler's city, the more skeptical people are of him. The closer Junka gets, the more people believe him to be divine.</li><li>Make sure Autumnal terrain is used - marshes, bogs, wetlands, dewie fields, etc.</li><li>Spear like weapon but with sharpened antlers</li><li>Include riddle in Fenraye's works - a prophecy that speaks of Junka, Klara, and Ekkir, saving the planet - the three chosen ones who the Mants should have been.</li><li>The feifdom houses are based on different deities from the Pantheon</li><li>New ruler working towards grand monument like pyramids</li><li>Gargoyle phrase: \"I've been to places now forgotten, at times where places then now are not\"</li><li>The name \"Kushim\" (the first known human name)</li><li>New ruler has statues of him in the form of beasts and gods</li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Loose Ideas</h2><ul><li>Secret illuminati style group who plot to bring down the new ruler (new ruler's hand of the king person is actually a member, but not a prominent one).</li><li>Book that cannot be destroyed.</li></ul><h1>Book 3: TBD</h1><h2>Loose Ideas</h2><ul><li>Klara changes replaces the Ussurian rule of the Temple Collective with an instution of technological learning in order to teach people who can build the technology required to save the planet - however, a lot of people are against this as they perceive it as an attack on the Spirits. Floke makes a new Temple Collective.</li><li>A dommahound that has survived but trapped by a great boulder, and has spend thousands of years/moons there due to its immortality. When the Dommahounds begin to rebuild, he becomes their new Dommaking.</li><li>Giant white eel \"myth\" which Junka battles whilst sailing to Erman lands. The coast is clouded by fog, strong waves, and storms, before he is attacked by the Eel. However, the eel that Junka faces might just be from a hallucination caused by eating a fish that was given to him. Nonetheless, he finds himself nearly dead at sea but to where he was wanting to go. Before his encounter, he receives coins with a snake - or an eels - symbol on it after buying something. After his encounter, someone says \"Ahh you faced the eel.&nbsp;Not all make it out alive...\" (the hallicination can kill people)</li><li>The Earthmen left their DNA splitting machine in the desert. Ekkir goes to it in order to \"save\" Heru.</li><li>The baskilla have taken over Dommasmere, ruling over the humans who used to serve the Dommahound. The Dommahound forces, however, are rebuilding.</li><li>Brutulus &amp; The Old Wizard who protects against dark forces, but is rejected by the town and so lives alone in a tower.</li><li>Naustaun is in ruins, but the Ermans are too passive to do anything about it, being high on opium like plants. Ermans like dandy angels who lounge around one fine cushion beds and smoke a pollen (like opium). They are always trying to&nbsp;do the greatest \"kindness\" to everyone via superficial gestures. They also love poetry and gentle music. They bath in angelic light and every word they spoke was uttered like a beautiful melody.</li></ul><h1>Book 4: TBD</h1><h2>Loose Ideas</h2><ul><li>Junka gets flown up into the sky by an Agnaven in order to speak to Illubeline and save the planet</li><li>When Junka reaches the point of becoming one with the Spirits, he sees Klara save the planet and is content</li><li>Klara creates \"planet moving\" device&nbsp;that utilises the power of the Spirits (but also deminishes their power).
