Forged in the fires of the planet’s formation, the three discarnate entities wandered the empty world as it cooled. They were formless beings, and their gaze touched every inch of the planet’s surface. They saw in it an endless potential and so they called it Heru, <em>that which will grow</em>. They gave it mountains and calved through their heights. A temporary chaos fell upon the world, until the waters had settled into oceans. Then they talked and agreed that Heru was complete. But a price had been paid for their creation: much of the Spirits power had been poured into the world, and thus they were eternally bound to it.</p><p><br></p><p>For many thousands of years, the three beings lived in harmony and took pleasure it what they had made. As they explored, their journeys took them on different paths and they gained a growth of their own. They remained pure, but their time apart had made them different. They took up names as symbols of their growth.</p><p><br></p><p>That which had lived amongst the clouds was named Illubeline, <em>Essence</em>. Illubeline had watched from above and had gained knowledge in all that could be seen below.</p><p><br></p><p>That which had roamed the fields and hillsides was named Edrenine, <em>Light</em>, for it had learned intimately of what had been graced by the sun.</p><p><br></p><p>That which had trekked the mountain ranges and searched the many underground tunnels was named Urunine, <em>Darkness,</em> for it had seen what the others had not.</p><p><br></p><p>Over time, Illubeline and Edrenine became formed a strong bond and loved one another greatly. Urunine, however, spent time alone amongst the dark tunnels of the deepest realms of the world and was angered when he discovered his exclusion from their friendship. No words of comfort from Illubeline or Edrenine could quell Urunine’s anger and so he retreated once more to the hidden parts of the world, where no light could reach.</p><p><br></p><p>Urunine’s isolation was short lived. One evening, on a night of pure blackness, Edrenine sought after Urunine. Through the long, winding tunnels of Mount Daayat, Edrenine called Urunine’s name and it was heard, for the name echoed to the bottom of the mountain. Urunine came forth and demanded a reason for the disturbance.</p><p><br></p><p>Edrenine spoke of their discovery; that the planet that had born them, that had had homed them, was doomed. Every passing year brought the planet of Heru closer to the Fire of Yatoll, the brilliant star at the centre of the system of six planets. Soon it would spiral to its fate, cast into the fire.</p><p><br></p><p>Urunine sent Edrenine away and retreated once again into the mountain’s heart. For many years Urunine pondered and plotted, until Urunine met Edrenine and Illubeline amongst the clouds on a silver night. Urunine spoke:</p><p><br></p><p>“A plan I have devised, to save the world we share.”</p><p><br></p><p>Urunine was praised for his selfless act, and a new friendship was formed between them all. Urunine explained his plan, and it followed thusly:</p><p><br></p><p><em>Of our beings follows no physical form, but the command of energy is ours. We can raise a mountain and pour a sea, but we cannot touch what is not of this world. Nor can we escape this worldly realm, for our very being is tied to our home. </em></p><p><br></p><p><em>Thus, we must use our powers to create physical beings that can achieve what we cannot, and we shall help them in their quest. To them we shall be guiding Spirits. We shall always answer their calls.</em></p><p><br></p><p>To this, Illubeline and Edrenine agreed and applauded Urunine for his idea. This strengthened their bonds of friendship.</p><p><br></p><p>So came the first beings of Heru. Together the three Spirits created the Life Seeds. </p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: red;\">[ INSERT SPECIAL PLACE FOR THE SEEDS TO BE KEPT ]</span></p><p><br></p><p>Where planted, the Life Seed could be instructed to grow a being as moulded by their thoughts. Where they wanted a leg, a leg would grow, and where they wanted a tail, a tail would grow. Each Spirit worked on their designs and added their instructions to a Life Seed.</p><p><br></p><p>First came the instigator, Urunine, <em>Darkness</em>. He had crafted an array of powerful beasts who would jump and beat the planet away from the path of Yatoll. These creatures were of gigantic proportions, tall and broad with fearsome features and shallow tempers. But no matter how high the beasts jumped, or how hard they beat the world, it did not move. Urunine, in all his knowledge and creativity, had misunderstood the physical laws of the universe in his formless existence. Frustrated by his creations, he released them from his command and so they wandered aimlessly across the land and found homes of their own.</p><p><br></p><p>Edrenine, <em>Light,</em> saw Urunine’s creations and saw their failings, and understood them. Edrenine believed that intelligence, not brute strength, was what was required to save Heru. Through a Life Seed, Edrenine created three lines of Erman beings, and let them wander freely to grow as they had done themselves. The Ermans were small in number, but great in knowledge and skill. Edrenine told the Erman people of Heru’s fate and asked them to use their minds to form a solution of the physical realm. However, Edrenine had made his creations of a similar image to himself, and the Erman race were apathetic in their goodness. They were kind and civilised but held no desire to explore and change, for they were content in all that was already good. They could not see past their immediate serenity.</p><p><br></p><p>Urunine was frustrated that he, despite his unique knowledge, had not thought to look to an intelligence aside from his own as a solution. Hastily he copied Edrenine and declared his creation original. He presented to Illubeline and Edrenine a new form of Ermans but instead of goodness, he had poured in his darkness, in the belief that it was greed that the Ermans had lacked, for what progress could be made without competition? Urunine had created the Dommahounds, a race of disruption and malice. In their malevolence they turned on the Ermans. A series of Great Wars erupted between the races. The Dommahounds finally won, and all but a small group of Ermans survived. They fled to empty lands where they hid amongst hills and walls for the rest of their days.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline had been watching from the clouds and had seen all. Despite his anger at Urunine for creating the Dommahounds, Illubeline saw quality in them, although Edrenine did not. And so Illubeline in his wisdom created a new race, the Humans, who had within their minds a balance of goodness and greed. Goodness enough to be kind, to love and to heal, but greedy enough to explore, to desire and to progress. But Illubeline took from the humans the gift of immortality with which the other races were gifted, and gave them short lifespans of about fifty moons, so that their desire to progress was hastened. Edrenine and Urunine congratulated Illubeline on his creation.</p><p><br></p><p>In secret, Illubeline created another race. Much alike in their appearance to humans, they were the controllers; the protectors. They were made truly independent. No Spirit could hear their calls, and no will of the Spirits could command action from them. They were separate from all that had been made before. The Astana they were named, and they were made to protect the humans from the three Spirits themselves, as well as their creations, for Illubeline had seen how the other Spirits become corrupted from their original purity. But the Astana, despite their might, were few in number and soon became lost within the rapidly expanding population of Humans.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: red;\">[ INSERT GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE RACES ]</span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But Urunine was watchful, for he was distrusting of Illubeline’s grace. He looked upon the Astana and watched with great anger the mingling of the Astana and the Humans. Urunine once again retreated to the shadows, where Illubeline’s eye could not reach, and to where the light of Edrenine would not will to venture. Carrying with him a great number of Life Seeds, Urunine began making foul beasts and set them upon the Earth to seek revenge against Illubeline’s betrayal.</p><p><br></p><p>Edrenine was amongst the fields of Ranarion. He admired his gardens and was glad. A dark shadow crept across the valley, and where this shadow touched came death and sorrow. Grasses turned to black, bitten by the coldest of frosts and marred with lifelessness. Trees withered, and flowers fell. Edrenine chased the shadow away and within it he felt the flavour of Urunine.</p><p><br></p><p>The sky was blue, and Illubeline watched the world below from atop a light cloud of the purest white. In this distance came blackness; a heavy storm approached. With it came winged beasts with sharp bladed teeth. They attacked the fairer flying creatures and killed them despite their innocence. Illubeline roared and the winged beasts retreated, and he healed all the death that the beasts had caused. As he healed the wounds, he sensed the doing of Urunine and was greatly angered.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline sought after Edrenine and found him tending to his tainted garden.</p><p><br></p><p>“This is of Urunine’s devising,” said Edrenine. “He has sent a shadow that leaches the life from anything within its reach (the Shadow’Durr, <em>Shadow of Death</em>).”</p><p><br></p><p>“My sky friends have also been hurt,” said Illubeline, “by winged beasts with sharp teeth. They were surely the making of Urunine.”</p><p><br></p><p>But they knew that confrontation with Urunine would cause a great upheaval, and they wanted only peace. It was now that Illubeline admitted to Edrenine the creation of the Astana. Edrenine was angered and cursed Illubeline for his betrayal. Edrenine ventured back to the fields, carrying with him a bounty of Life Seeds, and began making creatures of his own to protect against Urunine’s malice.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline too made creatures, who guarded the skies from any of Urunine’s foul creations.</p><p><br></p><p>This begun the War of Beasts.</p>","preface":"","date_created":"Tue Apr 16 2019 01:01:06 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","last_updated":"Tue Apr 16 2019 15:33:54 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)"},{"id":"The_Age_of_Creation","url":"The_Age_of_Creation","title":"The Age of Creation","category":"history","subcategory":"the age of creation","images":{"main":"","other":[]},"details":[],"body":"<h1>Timeline</h1><ul><li><strong>C3600-0-X</strong>: <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Urinine\"><strong><em>Urinine</em></strong></a><strong><em> crafts two powerful beasts from the </em></strong><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Life_Seeds\"><strong><em>Life Seeds</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Hagann-Tant\"><strong><em>Hagann-Tant</em></strong></a><strong><em>e and </em></strong><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Haguth-Khol\"><strong><em>Haguth-Khol</em></strong></a>, who are to jump and beat the planet away from the path of Yatoll, but they fail.</li><li><strong>C3500-0-X:<em> Creation of the Life Seeds.</em></strong> Upon discovering the planet's fate, Urinine arrived upon a solution: \"...we must use our powers to create physical beings that can achieve what we cannot, and we shall help them in their quest.

They gave it mountains and calved through their heights. A temporary chaos fell upon the world, until the waters had settled into oceans. Then they talked and agreed that Heru was complete. But a price had been paid for their creation: much of the Spirits power had been poured into the world, and thus they were eternally bound to it.</p><p><br></p><p>For many thousands of years, the three beings lived in harmony and took pleasure it what they had made.

One evening, on a night of pure blackness, Edrenine sought after Urunine.

Urunine spoke:</p><p><br></p><p>“A plan I have devised, to save the world we share.”</p><p><br></p><p>Urunine was praised for his selfless act, and a new friendship was formed between them all. Urunine explained his plan, and it followed thusly:</p><p><br></p><p><em>Of our beings follows no physical form, but the command of energy is ours. We can raise a mountain and pour a sea, but we cannot touch what is not of this world. Nor can we escape this worldly realm, for our very being is tied to our home. Thus, we must use our powers to create physical beings that can achieve what we cannot, and we shall help them in their quest. To them we shall be guiding Spirits. We shall always answer their calls.</em></p><p><br></p><p>To this, Illubeline and Edrenine agreed and applauded Urunine for his idea. This strengthened their bonds of friendship.</p><p>So came the first beings of Heru. Together the three Spirits created the Life Seeds and kept them in the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Garden_of_Life\">Garden of Life</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Where planted, the Life Seed could be instructed to grow a being as moulded by their thoughts. Where they wanted a leg, a leg would grow, and where they wanted a tail, a tail would grow.

He had crafted an array of powerful beasts who would jump and beat the planet away from the path of Yatoll. These creatures were of gigantic proportions, tall and broad with fearsome features and shallow tempers. But no matter how high the beasts jumped, or how hard they beat the world, it did not move. Urunine, in all his knowledge and creativity, had misunderstood the physical laws of the universe in his formless existence. Frustrated by his creations, he released them from his command and so they wandered aimlessly across the land and found homes of their own.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Saga Continues in </strong><a href=\"#/wiki/page/The_Age_of_Races\"><strong>The Age of Races</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>","preface":"","date_created":"Tue Apr 16 2019 01:01:06 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","last_updated":"Fri Apr 26 2019 23:36:13 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)"},{"id":"The_Age_of_Creation","url":"The_Age_of_Creation","title":"The Age of Creation","category":"history","subcategory":"the age of creation","images":{"main":"","other":[]},"details":[],"body":"<h1>Timeline</h1><ul><li><strong>C3600-0-X</strong>: <a href=\"Urunine\"><strong><em>Urunine</em></strong></a><strong><em> crafts two powerful beasts from the </em></strong><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Life_Seeds\"><strong><em>Life Seeds</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Hagann-Tante\"><strong><em>Hagann-Tante</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Haguth-Khol\"><strong><em>Haguth-Khol</em></strong></a>, who are to jump and beat the planet away from the path of Yatoll, but they fail.</li><li><strong>C3500-0-X:<em> Creation of the Life Seeds.</em></strong> Upon discovering the planet's fate, Urinine arrived upon a solution: \"...we must use our powers to create physical beings that can achieve what we cannot, and we shall help them in their quest.
