Upon realising their failure, Urunine let them free.</p><h2>The Age of Races</h2><p>Urunine called upon the Hagalisk to fight in the <a href=\"#/view/War_of_the_Beasts\">War of the Beasts</a> under the control of the Dommahound. When the War of the Beasts Ended, Urunine set them free once more, but the Dommahound kept their influence and they remained patrolling Dommasmeare. It was only when the War of Ruin ended, and the Dommahound were defeated, that they fled into the Vovoasian Range.</p><h2>The Age of Awakening</h2><p>The Hagalisk had remained in the Vovosian Range in hibernation for many moons. Hagann-Tante was called upon by Urunine during The Battle of Darkness. His wings had seized and thinned, his muscles had wasted, and his strength greatly diminished. He was  wounded, and fell over the edge of a great ravine.</p><h1>Appearance</h1><p>The Hagalisk of a general humanoid appearance. However, they stand at over a hundred feet tall, bear ceremonial wings upon their back, and each of the three have different formations of horns upon their head. They are muscular and powerful, although much of Hagann-Tante's strength had been lost during The Battle of Darkness from spending so many moons in hibernation. Their skin is thick and grey.</p><h1>The Three Hagalisk</h1><ul><li><a href=\"#/view/Hagann-Tante\">Hagann-Tante</a></li><li><a href=\"#/view/Haguth-Khol\">Haguth-Khol</a></li><li><a href=\"#/view/Hagal-Marth\">Hagal-Marth</a></li></ul>","preface":"<p>The Hagalisk are the three beasts made by Urunine during the Age of Creation.</p>","date_created":"Wed Apr 17 2019 22:09:06 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","last_updated":"Wed Apr 17 2019 22:09:06 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)"}]
