It is believed that either his family name gave the name to the region, or that his family name was inspired by the region. Vant Gorjosofar's eldest son Turu Gorjosofar became Mant Tummo in the Age of the First Men. In the oldest written histories documenting the Gorjosofar family it is said that the Gorjosofar line had already ruled Gorjovak since mankind was born, meaning that their dynasty had already lasted for 2000 moons, although this cannot be proven.</p><h2>Age of the First Men</h2><p>When Turu Gorjosofar rose to power, his father Vant Gorjosofar had already died, and Turu was already Cazar. However, he chose to adopt the new title of Mant to signify his greater power. He ordered for the construction of the fortress of Gor'kul, which still stands and has never once been breached in its entire history.</p><h2>Age of Uncertainty</h2><p>When Turu died, the contest for rulership began. The name of Gorjovak's next ruler is known only as \"Horrum\", and is thought to have been Turu's cousin on his Mother's side. Horrum readopted the title of Cazar, wishing not to be associated with the overthrown First Men, and thus the title remained throughout history. During the remainder of the age, Gorjovak stood as one of the few areas of stability due to its isolation. Whilst the Gorjon people have always been self-relient, the chaos of the Inditt Region cemented this mindset.</p><h1>Geography</h1><h2>Location</h2><p>Gorjovak is located in the far North-West of the Inditt Region. The kingdom's territory stretches further than the Mountains of Gorjovak, reaching slightly further South and East. At the base of the mountain range is the remainder of the <a href=\"#/view/Forest_of_Kunnbar\">Forest of Kunnbar</a>, now named the <a href=\"#/view/Forest_of_Handunn\">Forest of Handunn</a>.</p><h2>Climate</h2><p>Due to its elevation, Gorjovak experiences a perpetually colder climate, although winter seasons are especially cold and snow and ice become all-consuming.</p><p>Its climate has given rise to many regional variations of common animals, such as the <a href=\"#/view/Gorjon_Neguit\">Gorjon Neguit</a>, which grows exceptional thick wool, and also unique fauna and flora.&nbsp;</p><h1>Governance</h1><h2>Cazar</h2><p>A <a href=\"#/view/Cazar\">Cazar</a> governs the realm of Gorjovak from within the ancient fortress of <a href=\"#/view/Gor'kul\">Gor'kul</a>. Gorjovak is the only surviving monarchy in the Inditt Region, and it is said (but not confirmed) that the line of the monarchy descends from <a href=\"#/view/Mant_Tummo\">Mant Tummo</a>.&nbsp;The title of Cazar is usually passed to the Cazar's eldest child upon their death. A Cazar is sworn to serve the realm their entire life, and as such one may never abdicate.</p><h1>Architecture</h1><p>Most buildings are made using the plentiful supply of hard mountain stone, with tumber being used from the Forest of Handunn to provide roofing and outhouses. Watchtowers litter the mountain range, as well as a multitude of safe-houses for scouts and travellers alike to find refuge during adverse weather conditions.</p><p>There are no cities in Gorjovak. Whilst Gor'kul can house up to 5,000 men, the largest settlement is Dieradorr in the Eastern parts of the range, which has a population of about 30,000.</p><h1>Culture</h1><h2>People</h2><p>The Gorjan people are a proud culture who tend to be hostile to outside cultural influence.
