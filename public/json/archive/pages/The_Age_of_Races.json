Most industrious in their growth were the Humans; the reaches of their settlements knew little in the way of bounds, and so it was that most of the historic events to occur during the Age of Races include the Humans to some degree. So numerous were the clans, their mortal leaders, and the note-worthy occasions that their people participated in, that it would be impractical to list them all. </p><p><br></p><p><u>The Erman Race</u></p><p>For the Ermans, reclusive and territorial, their history is contained within the North-East regions of the Seen Lands. Their numbers were few, and their lines were short, but their impact great, for the strength and longevity of a single Erman held the weight of a thousand Humans or more.</p><p><br></p><p>To the East of the Balmare Range, and then over a raging river that fed from the North Sea, lay the Erman city of Naustaun. It was of such great beauty that one would be forgiven for believing that, as they strolled the city streets and entered the Erman Temples, they walked through a waking dream. To the Humans, the city became but a legend of ancient days, and the presence of Ermans was soon forgotten after the War of the Beasts had ended. But the Ermans were not without unwanted visitors, for to the South of their great city lay the spoiled mountains of the Dommasmeare – the wretched lair of the race of the Dommahounds.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Ermans did not reproduce in the same way as their Human counterparts and they shared this trait with their enemies, the Dommahounds: for each Erman was neither male nor female, but a combination of both, and their perceived gender of masculine or feminine traits merely an expression of genetic traits. It stood, however, that only those whose genes expressed the individual to be a female had the ability to reproduce, yet no form of procreation was required. On the rare occasion that a “female” Erman deemed it safe enough to begin the development of new life (a purely biological decision made by hormonal balances and low levels of stress - a factor made by Edrenine himself to encourage harmony and civility within the race), they would bear a child in their womb for a complete moon cycle, and give birth to an Erman child. Their offspring would look much like their Bearer (the name given to the carrier of the child, for the concepts of Mother and Father were unknown), but not identical. </p><p><br></p><p>The first of the Ermans, of which there were three, were Galalorn, Merdana and Kalorna. Each of them marked the beginning of distinct lines, both in appearance and identity. These were named by their line as the <em>Ivormass, </em>the great leaders of the Ermans.</p><p>From Galalorn, Byernos was born. From Byernos, Byesol and Byanon were born. Each of Byernos’ children had two children of their own, all women, and the matriarch of the Galaornian line was established. Byernos’ grandchildren had many children, who in turn had children of their own, some female and some male.</p><p>From Merdana, Mergurn and Mersanna were born. Each of Merdana’s children had two children of their own, all women, and the matriarch of the Merdanan line was established. Merdana’s grandchildren had many children, who in turn had children of their own, some female and some male.</p><p>From Kalaorna, Balnorn and Kalkorvon were born. Balnorn is the only man to be descended from the first of an Erman line, and he was respected for both his unique position, and his ability as a leader of line. Kalkorvon had two daughters, Kalsonet and Kalbranto, who in turn each had two children – one man and one woman for both of Kalkorvon’s daughters. Such was the difference in dynamic that the line was not lead by a group of the elder women, but by Kalorna and her children alone, and the Kalornan line ended as the smallest of the three Erman lines.</p><p><br></p><p><u>The Dommahounds</u></p><p><br></p><p><u>The Astanan Race</u></p><p><br></p><p><u>The Human Race</u></p><p><br></p><p><u>The War of the Beasts</u></p><p>The Humans cowered as a swathe of monsters scoured Heru. All that was golden was tainted with decay, and the growth that the world had enjoyed began to fade.</p><p>Urunine called upon the monsters he had created with the first Life Seeds, for they were made during a time where no limitations applied. Urunine whistled, and forth came the beasts of Hagann-Tante and Haguth-Khol. They were beasts who stood tall as mountains and were built to shake the ground. Tremendous was their might, fearsome was their look. Great horns protruded from their skulls. Hagann-Tante grew horns that pierced against the air around him like thorns, whereas Haguth-Khol bore spiralling prongs like a ram.</p><p>With the two brethren beasts followed the Shadow’Dorr, the black mist of death and sorrow. It lingered like a smog and drew away the light. Protected by the Shadow’Dorr, smaller beasts acted like pawns, to soldier against those that would otherwise distract Hagann-Tante and Hagoth-Khol from their menace.</p><p>Urunine also created the Gargoyles, five humanoid beings whose power lay not in strength but in a wicked tongue. With cunning words, even the most cautious could succumb to the will of the Gargoyles. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Edrenine made the Otameng, creatures that resembled goats but walked and talked as if they were men. Their ways were of peace, yet they knew also of war, and with great horns they fought the fiercest of foes. But their weapon was to inspire harmony, for they were peaceful creatures of the forests. Yet too pure they were, for one of the Otameng, of which there were two, fell prey to the worming words of the Gargoyles. Under the spell of Urenine’s Gargoyles, one of the Otameng forsook his creature and turned to the darkness, where it remained forever poisoned by it. Many forest-dwelling humans worshipped the Otameng who remained loyal to Edrenine, and pagan like religions emerged in their honour.</p><p>Edrenine also created the Baskilla: with the look of a devil they bathed in fire and flame. Deep underground they were sent, to infiltrate the depths of the tunnels of Urenine, where they were ordered to spread their fire and light up the tunnels. Their presence inspired Human devotes, who worshipped them as deities, and lived in the tunnels as their sevents.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline created a flock of flaming winged beasts, which burnt bright not with the evil hotness of flame, but with the brightness needed to illuminate that which was dark. They were called the Agnaven, and within the roaring fires of their wings was a body, but by sight body and flame merged into one, save for their head which was clearly visible. Their eyes glowed like hot coals, and their wingspan reached a near mile.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: red;\">[ Details of War Needed – History, Geography, Beasts &amp; their personalities ]</span></p><p><br></p><p>As the War of the Beasts raged on, Humans fought against any monster that came their way. They knew not of the beast’s origins but knew only that the people of their own race would be destroyed in the wake of the beasts.</p><p><br></p><p>Edrenine and Illubeline’s creations were no match for the unrestricted brutality of Hagann-Tante and Haguth-Khol. The Dark beast’s barbarous hands reached into the sky and plucked Illubeline’s Agnaven by their heads and then submerged them into the lakes to quell their fiery skin, which was their life source. Soon Illubeline and Edrenine’s beasts had been destroyed, although many of Urunine’s other creations had also been killed in the fighting. And so Illubeline and Edrenine turned to the Humans for help. Illubeline whispered words of dread the into the winds that passed over the settlements of the Humans.</p><p>The Humans, now fearful of Urunine’s beasts in a way they were not before, for they knew not of what events transpired far away, decided upon a war of their own. Great armies were called upon and the Battle of Beast and Human began.</p><p><br></p><p>Edrenine searched for the remaining Ermans. They had settled in the North East and had multiplied, but so too had their passiveness and they refused to engage in a war that had not touched their lands.</p><p><br></p><p>As the war went on, it became clear that the Humans were fated for defeat. Illubeline came down to the Earth and sang all living beings into a deep slumber. Then, he called upon Edrenine and Uruline.</p><p>“We shall have no more death,” he said. “For we share the same purpose. Let us put aside our anger. The mistake is mine, for I should not have created the Astana without your counsel. Alas, my reasons have proved true, for we have fallen into the trap of anger, and now our rage threatens the existence of all that we have worked hard to build.”</p><p>Edrenine and Uruline saw the truth in Illubeline’s words. When their creations awoke, they were commanded away from one another. Uruline sent Hagann-Tante and Haguth-Khol back to the mountains, where they rested and healed from their many wounds. Edrenine recovered what creations of his that had survived and told them to find new homes of their own in distant realms. </p><p>Illubeline commanded the Humans to go back to their own lands. He breathed into them the desire to use their loving sides so that they could recover and regrow.</p><p><br></p><p><u>The War of Ruin</u></p><p><span style=\"color: red;\">[ INSERT BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE WAR ]</span></p>","preface":"","date_created":"Tue Apr 16 2019 01:08:07 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","last_updated":"Tue Apr 16 2019 15:37:08 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)"},{"id":"The_Age_of_Races","url":"The_Age_of_Races","title":"The Age of Races","category":"history","subcategory":"the age of races","images":{"main":"","other":[]},"details":[],"body":"<h1>Timeline</h1><ul><li><strong>R183-0-X:<em> The End of </em></strong><a href=\"#/view/The_War_of_the_Beasts\"><strong><em>The War of the Beasts</em></strong></a><strong>: </strong>Seeing the destruction of the <a href=\"#/view/Humans\">Humans</a>, <a href=\"#/view/Illubeline\">Illubeline</a> calls upon <a href=\"#/view/Urunine\">Urunine</a> and <a href=\"#/view/Edrenine\">Edrenine</a> to form a truce, an the War of the Beasts is ended.</li><li><strong>R182-0-X:<em> Human-Beast conflict:</em></strong><em> </em>Many of the Spirit's creations knew not of the humans, and so attacked them as if they were enemies.

Most industrious in their growth were the Humans; the reaches of their settlements knew little in the way of bounds, and so it was that most of the historic events to occur during the Age of Races include the Humans to some degree. So numerous were the clans, their mortal leaders, and the note-worthy occasions that their people participated in, that it would be impractical to list them all.</p><p><br></p><p><u>The Erman Race</u></p><p><strong><em>See: </em></strong><a href=\"#/view/Ermans\">Ermans</a></p><p>For the Ermans, reclusive and territorial, their history is contained within the North-East regions of the Seen Lands. Their numbers were few, and their lines were short, but their impact great, for the strength and longevity of a single Erman held the weight of a thousand Humans or more.</p><p><br></p><p>To the East of the Balmare Range, and then over a raging river that fed from the North Sea, lay the Erman city of Naustaun. It was of such great beauty that one would be forgiven for believing that, as they strolled the city streets and entered the Erman Temples, they walked through a waking dream. To the Humans, the city became but a legend of ancient days, and the presence of Ermans was soon forgotten after the War of the Beasts had ended. But the Ermans were not without unwanted visitors, for to the South of their great city lay the spoiled mountains of the Dommasmeare – the wretched lair of the race of the Dommahounds.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Ermans did not reproduce in the same way as their Human counterparts and they shared this trait with their enemies, the Dommahounds: for each Erman was neither male nor female, but a combination of both, and their perceived gender of masculine or feminine traits merely an expression of genetic traits. It stood, however, that only those whose genes expressed the individual to be a female had the ability to reproduce, yet no form of procreation was required. On the rare occasion that a “female” Erman deemed it safe enough to begin the development of new life (a purely biological decision made by hormonal balances and low levels of stress - a factor made by Edrenine himself to encourage harmony and civility within the race), they would bear a child in their womb for a complete moon cycle, and give birth to an Erman child. Their offspring would look much like their Bearer (the name given to the carrier of the child, for the concepts of Mother and Father were unknown), but not identical.</p><p><br></p><p>The first of the Ermans, of which there were three, were Galalorn, Merdana and Kalorna. Each of them marked the beginning of distinct lines, both in appearance and identity. These were named by their line as the <em>Ivormass, </em>the great leaders of the Ermans.</p><p>From Galalorn, Byernos was born. From Byernos, Byesol and Byanon were born. Each of Byernos’ children had two children of their own, all women, and the matriarch of the Galaornian line was established. Byernos’ grandchildren had many children, who in turn had children of their own, some female and some male.</p><p>From Merdana, Mergurn and Mersanna were born. Each of Merdana’s children had two children of their own, all women, and the matriarch of the Merdanan line was established. Merdana’s grandchildren had many children, who in turn had children of their own, some female and some male.</p><p>From Kalaorna, Balnorn and Kalkorvon were born. Balnorn is the only man to be descended from the first of an Erman line, and he was respected for both his unique position, and his ability as a leader of line.

Soon Illubeline and Edrenine’s beasts had been destroyed, although many of Urunine’s other creations had also been killed in the fighting. And so Illubeline and Edrenine turned to the Humans for help. Illubeline whispered words of dread the into the winds that passed over the settlements of the Humans.</p><p>The Humans, now fearful of Urunine’s beasts in a way they were not before, for they knew not of what events transpired far away, decided upon a war of their own. Great armies were called upon and the Battle of Beast and Human began.</p><p><br></p><p>Edrenine searched for the remaining Ermans. They had settled in the North East and had multiplied, but so too had their passiveness and they refused to engage in a war that had not touched their lands.</p><p><br></p><p>As the war went on, it became clear that the Humans were fated for defeat. Illubeline came down to the Earth and sang all living beings into a deep slumber. Then, he called upon Edrenine and Uruline.</p><p>“We shall have no more death,” he said. “For we share the same purpose. Let us put aside our anger. The mistake is mine, for I should not have created the Astana without your counsel. Alas, my reasons have proved true, for we have fallen into the trap of anger, and now our rage threatens the existence of all that we have worked hard to build.”</p><p>Edrenine and Uruline saw the truth in Illubeline’s words. When their creations awoke, they were commanded away from one another. Uruline sent Hagann-Tante and Haguth-Khol back to the mountains, where they rested and healed from their many wounds. Edrenine recovered what creations of his that had survived and told them to find new homes of their own in distant realms.</p><p>Illubeline commanded the Humans to go back to their own lands. He breathed into them the desire to use their loving sides so that they could recover and regrow.</p><p><br></p><p><u>The War of Ruin</u></p><p><strong><em>See: </em></strong><a href=\"#/view/The_War_of_Ruin\">The War of Ruin</a>, <a href=\"#/view/Norderann's_Journey\">Norderann's Journey</a>, <a href=\"#/view/Of_Norderann\">Of Norderann</a></p><p><span style=\"color: red;\">[ INSERT BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE WAR ]</span></p>","preface":"","date_created":"Tue Apr 16 2019 01:08:07 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)","last_updated":"Tue Apr 16 2019 17:10:18 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)"},{"id":"The_Age_of_Races","url":"The_Age_of_Races","title":"The Age of Races","category":"history","subcategory":"the age of races","images":{"main":"","other":[]},"details":[],"body":"<h1>Timeline</h1><ul><li><strong>R183-0-X:<em> The End of </em></strong><a href=\"#/view/The_War_of_the_Beasts\"><strong><em>The War of the Beasts</em></strong></a><strong>: </strong>Seeing the destruction of the <a href=\"#/view/Humans\">Humans</a>, <a href=\"#/view/Illubeline\">Illubeline</a> calls upon <a href=\"#/view/Urunine\">Urunine</a> and <a href=\"#/view/Edrenine\">Edrenine</a> to form a truce, an the War of the Beasts is ended.</li><li><strong>R182-0-X:<em> Human-Beast conflict:</em></strong><em> </em>Many of the Spirit's creations knew not of the humans, and so attacked them as if they were enemies.

Edrenine believed that intelligence, not brute strength, was what was required to save Heru. Through a Life Seed, Edrenine created three lines of Erman beings, and let them wander freely to grow as they had done themselves. The Ermans were small in number, but great in knowledge and skill. Edrenine told the Erman people of Heru’s fate and asked them to use their minds to form a solution of the physical realm. However, Edrenine had made his creations of a similar image to himself, and the Erman race were apathetic in their goodness. They were kind and civilised but held no desire to explore and change, for they were content in all that was already good. They could not see past their immediate serenity.</p><p><br></p><p>Urunine was frustrated that he, despite his unique knowledge, had not thought to look to an intelligence aside from his own as a solution. Hastily he copied Edrenine and declared his creation original. He presented to Illubeline and Edrenine a new form of Ermans but instead of goodness, he had poured in his darkness, in the belief that it was greed that the Ermans had lacked, for what progress could be made without competition? Urunine had created the Dommahounds, a race of disruption and malice. In their malevolence they turned on the Ermans. A series of Great Wars erupted between the races. The Dommahounds finally won, and all but a small group of Ermans survived. They fled to empty lands where they hid amongst hills and walls for the rest of their days.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline had been watching from the clouds and had seen all. Despite his anger at Urunine for creating the Dommahounds, Illubeline saw quality in them, although Edrenine did not. And so Illubeline in his wisdom created a new race, the Humans, who had within their minds a balance of goodness and greed. Goodness enough to be kind, to love and to heal, but greedy enough to explore, to desire and to progress. But Illubeline took from the humans the gift of immortality with which the other races were gifted, and gave them short lifespans of about fifty moons, so that their desire to progress was hastened. Edrenine and Urunine congratulated Illubeline on his creation.</p><p><br></p><p>In secret, Illubeline created another race. Much alike in their appearance to humans, they were the controllers; the protectors. They were made truly independent. No Spirit could hear their calls, and no will of the Spirits could command action from them. They were separate from all that had been made before. The Astana they were named, and they were made to protect the humans from the three Spirits themselves, as well as their creations, for Illubeline had seen how the other Spirits become corrupted from their original purity. But the Astana, despite their might, were few in number and soon became lost within the rapidly expanding population of Humans, who migrated in ever-growing numbers into the <a href=\"#/view/Northern_Realm\">Northern Realm</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But Urunine was watchful, for he was distrusting of Illubeline’s grace. He looked upon the Astana and watched with great anger the mingling of the Astana and the Humans. Urunine once again retreated to the shadows, where Illubeline’s eye could not reach, and to where the light of Edrenine would not will to venture. Carrying with him a great number of Life Seeds, Urunine began making foul beasts and set them upon the Earth to seek revenge against Illubeline’s betrayal.</p><p><br></p><p>Edrenine was amongst the fields of <a href=\"#/view/Ranarion\">Ranarion</a>. He admired his gardens and was glad. A dark shadow crept across the valley, and where this shadow touched came death and sorrow. Grasses turned to black, bitten by the coldest of frosts and marred with lifelessness. Trees withered, and flowers fell. Edrenine chased the shadow away and within it he felt the flavour of Urunine.</p><p><br></p><p>The sky was blue, and Illubeline watched the world below from atop a light cloud of the purest white. In this distance came blackness; a heavy storm approached. With it came winged beasts with sharp bladed teeth. They attacked the fairer flying creatures and killed them despite their innocence. Illubeline roared and the winged beasts retreated, and he healed all the death that the beasts had caused. As he healed the wounds, he sensed the doing of Urunine and was greatly angered.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline sought after Edrenine and found him tending to his tainted garden.</p><p>“This is of Urunine’s devising,” said Edrenine. “He has sent a shadow that leaches the life from anything within its reach (the Shadow’Durr, <em>Shadow of Death</em>).”</p><p>“My sky friends have also been hurt,” said Illubeline, “by winged beasts with sharp teeth. They were surely the making of Urunine.”</p><p><br></p><p>But they knew that confrontation with Urunine would cause a great upheaval, and they wanted only peace. It was now that Illubeline admitted to Edrenine the creation of the Astana. Edrenine was angered and cursed Illubeline for his betrayal. Edrenine ventured back to the fields, carrying with him a bounty of Life Seeds, and began making creatures of his own to protect against Urunine’s malice.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline too made creatures, who guarded the skies from any of Urunine’s foul creations.</p><p><br></p><p>This begun <a href=\"#/view/The_War_of_Beasts\">The War of Beasts</a>.</p><p><br></p><p>Humans:</p><p>For each race of Blessed beings, fiefdoms of varying structures established themselves across the lands.

Through a Life Seed, Edrenine created three lines of Erman beings, and let them wander freely to grow as they had done themselves. The Ermans were small in number, but great in knowledge and skill. Edrenine told the Erman people of Heru’s fate and asked them to use their minds to form a solution of the physical realm. However, Edrenine had made his creations of a similar image to himself, and the Erman race were apathetic in their goodness. They were kind and civilised but held no desire to explore and change, for they were content in all that was already good. They could not see past their immediate serenity.</p><p><br></p><p>Urunine was frustrated that he, despite his unique knowledge, had not thought to look to an intelligence aside from his own as a solution. Hastily he copied Edrenine and declared his creation original. He presented to Illubeline and Edrenine a new form of Ermans but instead of goodness, he had poured in his darkness, in the belief that it was greed that the Ermans had lacked, for what progress could be made without competition? Urunine had created the Dommahounds, a race of disruption and malice. In their malevolence they turned on the Ermans. A series of Great Wars erupted between the races. The Dommahounds finally won, and all but a small group of Ermans survived. They fled to empty lands where they hid amongst hills and walls for the rest of their days.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline had been watching from the clouds and had seen all. Despite his anger at Urunine for creating the Dommahounds, Illubeline saw quality in them, although Edrenine did not. And so Illubeline in his wisdom created a new race, the Humans, who had within their minds a balance of goodness and greed. Goodness enough to be kind, to love and to heal, but greedy enough to explore, to desire and to progress. But Illubeline took from the humans the gift of immortality with which the other races were gifted, and gave them short lifespans of about fifty moons, so that their desire to progress was hastened. Edrenine and Urunine congratulated Illubeline on his creation.</p><p><br></p><p>In secret, Illubeline created another race. Much alike in their appearance to humans, they were the controllers; the protectors. They were made truly independent. No Spirit could hear their calls, and no will of the Spirits could command action from them. They were separate from all that had been made before. The Astana they were named, and they were made to protect the humans from the three Spirits themselves, as well as their creations, for Illubeline had seen how the other Spirits become corrupted from their original purity. But the Astana, despite their might, were few in number and soon became lost within the rapidly expanding population of Humans, who migrated in ever-growing numbers into the <a href=\"#/view/Northern_Realm\">Northern Realm</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But Urunine was watchful, for he was distrusting of Illubeline’s grace. He looked upon the Astana and watched with great anger the mingling of the Astana and the Humans. Urunine once again retreated to the shadows, where Illubeline’s eye could not reach, and to where the light of Edrenine would not will to venture. Carrying with him a great number of Life Seeds, Urunine began making foul beasts and set them upon the Earth to seek revenge against Illubeline’s betrayal.</p><p><br></p><p>Edrenine was amongst the fields of <a href=\"#/view/Ranarion\">Ranarion</a>.

Edrenine believed that intelligence, not brute strength, was what was required to save Heru. Through a Life Seed, Edrenine created three lines of Erman beings, and let them wander freely to grow as they had done themselves. The Ermans were small in number, but great in knowledge and skill. Edrenine told the Erman people of Heru’s fate and asked them to use their minds to form a solution of the physical realm. However, Edrenine had made his creations of a similar image to himself, and the Erman race were apathetic in their goodness. They were kind and civilised but held no desire to explore and change, for they were content in all that was already good. They could not see past their immediate serenity.</p><p><br></p><p>Urunine was frustrated that he, despite his unique knowledge, had not thought to look to an intelligence aside from his own as a solution. Hastily he copied Edrenine and declared his creation original. He presented to Illubeline and Edrenine a new form of Ermans but instead of goodness, he had poured in his darkness, in the belief that it was greed that the Ermans had lacked, for what progress could be made without competition? Urunine had created the Dommahounds, a race of disruption and malice. In their malevolence they turned on the Ermans. A series of Great Wars erupted between the races. The Dommahounds finally won, and all but a small group of Ermans survived. They fled to empty lands where they hid amongst hills and walls for the rest of their days.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline had been watching from the clouds and had seen all. Despite his anger at Urunine for creating the Dommahounds, Illubeline saw quality in them, although Edrenine did not. And so Illubeline in his wisdom created a new race, the Humans, who had within their minds a balance of goodness and greed. Goodness enough to be kind, to love and to heal, but greedy enough to explore, to desire and to progress. But Illubeline took from the humans the gift of immortality with which the other races were gifted, and gave them short lifespans of about fifty moons, so that their desire to progress was hastened. Edrenine and Urunine congratulated Illubeline on his creation.</p><p><br></p><p>In secret, Illubeline created another race. Much alike in their appearance to humans, they were the controllers; the protectors. They were made truly independent. No Spirit could hear their calls, and no will of the Spirits could command action from them. They were separate from all that had been made before. The Astana they were named, and they were made to protect the humans from the three Spirits themselves, as well as their creations, for Illubeline had seen how the other Spirits become corrupted from their original purity. But the Astana, despite their might, were few in number and soon became lost within the rapidly expanding population of Humans, who migrated in ever-growing numbers into the <a href=\"#/view/Northern_Realm\">Northern Realm</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But Urunine was watchful, for he was distrusting of Illubeline’s grace. He looked upon the Astana and watched with great anger the mingling of the Astana and the Humans. Urunine once again retreated to the shadows, where Illubeline’s eye could not reach, and to where the light of Edrenine would not will to venture. Carrying with him a great number of Life Seeds, Urunine began making foul beasts and set them upon the Earth to seek revenge against Illubeline’s betrayal.</p><p><br></p><p>Edrenine was amongst the fields of <a href=\"#/view/Ranarion\">Ranarion</a>. He admired his gardens and was glad. A dark shadow crept across the valley, and where this shadow touched came death and sorrow. Grasses turned to black, bitten by the coldest of frosts and marred with lifelessness. Trees withered, and flowers fell. Edrenine chased the shadow away and within it he felt the flavour of Urunine.</p><p><br></p><p>The sky was blue, and Illubeline watched the world below from atop a light cloud of the purest white. In this distance came blackness; a heavy storm approached. With it came winged beasts with sharp bladed teeth. They attacked the fairer flying creatures and killed them despite their innocence. Illubeline roared and the winged beasts retreated, and he healed all the death that the beasts had caused. As he healed the wounds, he sensed the doing of Urunine and was greatly angered.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline sought after Edrenine and found him tending to his tainted garden.</p><p>“This is of Urunine’s devising,” said Edrenine. “He has sent a shadow that leaches the life from anything within its reach (the Shadow’Durr, <em>Shadow of Death</em>).”</p><p>“My sky friends have also been hurt,” said Illubeline, “by winged beasts with sharp teeth.

Edrenine believed that intelligence, not brute strength, was what was required to save Heru. Through a Life Seed, Edrenine created three lines of Erman beings, and let them wander freely to grow as they had done themselves. The Ermans were small in number, but great in knowledge and skill. Edrenine told the Erman people of Heru’s fate and asked them to use their minds to form a solution of the physical realm. However, Edrenine had made his creations of a similar image to himself, and the Erman race were apathetic in their goodness. They were kind and civilised but held no desire to explore and change, for they were content in all that was already good. They could not see past their immediate serenity.</p><p><br></p><p>Urunine was frustrated that he, despite his unique knowledge, had not thought to look to an intelligence aside from his own as a solution. Hastily he copied Edrenine and declared his creation original. He presented to Illubeline and Edrenine a new form of Ermans but instead of goodness, he had poured in his darkness, in the belief that it was greed that the Ermans had lacked, for what progress could be made without competition? Urunine had created the Dommahounds, a race of disruption and malice. In their malevolence they turned on the Ermans. A series of Great Wars erupted between the races. The Dommahounds finally won, and all but a small group of Ermans survived. They fled to empty lands where they hid amongst hills and walls for the rest of their days.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline had been watching from the clouds and had seen all. Despite his anger at Urunine for creating the Dommahounds, Illubeline saw quality in them, although Edrenine did not. And so Illubeline in his wisdom created a new race, the Humans, who had within their minds a balance of goodness and greed. Goodness enough to be kind, to love and to heal, but greedy enough to explore, to desire and to progress. But Illubeline took from the humans the gift of immortality with which the other races were gifted, and gave them short lifespans of about fifty moons, so that their desire to progress was hastened. Edrenine and Urunine congratulated Illubeline on his creation.</p><p><br></p><p>In secret, Illubeline created another race. Much alike in their appearance to humans, they were the controllers; the protectors. They were made truly independent. No Spirit could hear their calls, and no will of the Spirits could command action from them. They were separate from all that had been made before. The Astana they were named, and they were made to protect the humans from the three Spirits themselves, as well as their creations, for Illubeline had seen how the other Spirits become corrupted from their original purity. But the Astana, despite their might, were few in number and soon became lost within the rapidly expanding population of Humans, who migrated in ever-growing numbers into the <a href=\"#/view/Northern_Realm\">Northern Realm</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But Urunine was watchful, for he was distrusting of Illubeline’s grace. He looked upon the Astana and watched with great anger the mingling of the Astana and the Humans. Urunine once again retreated to the shadows, where Illubeline’s eye could not reach, and to where the light of Edrenine would not will to venture. Carrying with him a great number of Life Seeds, Urunine began making foul beasts and set them upon the Earth to seek revenge against Illubeline’s betrayal.</p><p><br></p><p>Edrenine was amongst the fields of <a href=\"#/view/Ranarion\">Ranarion</a>. He admired his gardens and was glad. A dark shadow crept across the valley, and where this shadow touched came death and sorrow.

Edrenine chased the shadow away and within it he felt the flavour of Urunine.</p><p><br></p><p>The sky was blue, and Illubeline watched the world below from atop a light cloud of the purest white. In this distance came blackness; a heavy storm approached. With it came winged beasts with sharp bladed teeth. They attacked the fairer flying creatures and killed them despite their innocence. Illubeline roared and the winged beasts retreated, and he healed all the death that the beasts had caused. As he healed the wounds, he sensed the doing of Urunine and was greatly angered.</p><p><br></p><p>Illubeline sought after Edrenine and found him tending to his tainted garden.</p><p>“This is of Urunine’s devising,” said Edrenine. “He has sent a shadow that leaches the life from anything within its reach (the Shadow’Durr, <em>Shadow of Death</em>).”</p><p>“My sky friends have also been hurt,” said Illubeline, “by winged beasts with sharp teeth.
