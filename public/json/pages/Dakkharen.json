They are the half-blood descendants of the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Astana\">Astana</a>, and as such they cannot interact with the Spirits, or be affected by Spiritual spells. Over time the Dakkharen grew accustomed to the inhospitable desert, and the wondering community survived and grew in number. The lands they have travelled remain as deserts even amongst the Blessed Seasons, and so they know only of a desert-bound existence.</p><p>The heat has caused the Dakkharen to grow shorter in order to require less water, but they are strong and sturdy and can speed across the loose desert sands with their wide feet. They are hardy, and do not require as much food and water as most other races. They have red eyes and darker than usual skin.</p>","date_created":1555085249000,"last_updated":1566890531408}
