The Southern Road was built to create this route using granite mined from <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Kuru\">Kuru</a>, which at the time was under the control of the Ussurians.</p><h1>Notable Features</h1><h2>Stable Exchange</h2><p>In most cities, excluding Gorjovak, and along the roads connecting the various cities, there are a network of stables that can hire out beasts of burden which can be exchanged elsewhere for a fresh beast. This complex exchange is managed in Mutasaih, wherein the charges of stabling and returning beasts to their original stables are calculated and levelled.</p><p>This enables travellers, for a small fee, to reduce journey times and risk by replacing their beasts of burden with fresh legs, often multiple times during their journey.</p><h2>Water Wells</h2><p>A series of water wells are positioned along the Southern Road. Most are managed by Ussur and Mutasaih, whilst some are of private ownership. Both state and private wells generally charge for their services, unless grants or passes are provided by the cities.</p>","preface":"<p>The Southern Road is an old road that leads from Ussur to Mustasaih.</p>","date_created":1571422274774,"last_updated":1571422384534}
