The Ermans were the first of the four races, created by Edrenine. Ultimately they failed to provide what was needed to save the planet due to their apathetic, albeit gentle, nature.</p><h2>The Age of Races</h2><p>When <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Urunine\">Urunine</a> created the race of the Dommahound, the two races instantly clashed due to their conflicting natures. <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Erman-Dommahound_Conflict\">Erman-Dommahound Conflict</a> continued throughout T<a href=\"#/wiki/page/he_Age_of_Races\">he Age of Races</a> until finally the Ermans were victorious, maked by the end of <a href=\"#/wiki/page/The_War_of_Ruin\">The War of Ruin</a>. However, they suffered heavy casualities themselves and vowed never to fight again.</p><h2>The Age of Empires - The Age of Awakening</h2><p>The Ermans remained in perpetual stagnation for the remainder of the ages. Their cities fell into ruin, and in their apathy and lesser numbers there was no motivation to rebuild them. They submitted their lives to an opium-like drug in their belief that pleasure was the ultimate reason for existence.</p><h1>Genealogy</h1><h2>Reproduction</h2><p>Ëmans do not reproduce in the same way as their <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Humans\">Human</a> and <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Astana\">Astanan</a> counterparts, and instead share the same method of reproduction as their Dommahound enemies. An Erman is genetically neither male nor female, but a combination of both, and their perceived gender of masculine or feminine traits merely an expression of their genetic makeup. However, only those whose genes expressed the individual to be a female had the ability to reproduce, yet no form of procreation was required. Via a biological signal involving hormonal balances relating to lower levels of stress - a method designed by Edrenine to encourage harmony and civility within the race - a “female” Erman can only bare offpsring when her body deems it safe to do so. They carry their child for a complete <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Moon-Year\">Moon</a>.</p><p>Their offspring look very similar their Bearer (the name given to the carrier of the child - the concepts of Mother and Father were unknown), but not identical.</p><h2>Genealogy &amp; The Three Families</h2><p>When Edrenine first created the Ermans, he made only three. These were <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Gabadin\">Gabadin</a>, <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Kũbadin\">Kũbadin </a>and X. Subsequent generations of Ermans named these three the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Ivömas\">Ivömas</a>, meaning \"The Great Leaders\".</p><ul><li><strong>Gabadin </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♀</span></li><li>- Baradin <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♀</span></li><li>--- Renöra <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♀</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">----- Ћ</span>ẽneska <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♀</span></li><li>------- Nabüsk <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♂</span></li><li>------- Tobãn <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♂</span></li><li>----- Çaramin<span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♀</span></li><li>------- Tavamin <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♀</span></li><li>------- Đäspĩ <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♀</span></li><li>--- Mevus <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♀</span></li><li>----- Tabĩ <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♂</span></li><li>----- Sarëmäta <span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♂</span></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Kũbadin </strong><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">♀</span></li><li>- Bũ<span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">þadin ♀</span></li><li><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34);\">--- </span>Şõlẽk</li><li>-----Mantẽtë</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><strong>Töbadin</strong></li><li>- Vönadin</li></ul><h1>Location</h1><p>The Ermans settled in the North-East parts of the Seen Lands.
