The city is built between two great hills: the Westwards hill of Kwalla-Lai (Brother Hill) and the Eastwards hill of <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Kwalla-Norai\">Kwalla-Norai</a> (Sister Hill). The Ussurian province stretches in all directions from the city. In the South are the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Ussurian_Laylands\">Ussurian Laylands</a>, a largely unused area which contains miles of wild <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Yugga\">Yugga</a>, as well as Northward, Eastward and Westward expansions which are used for agriculture until the more fertile grounds turn into arid desert.</p><h2>Climate</h2><p>During the Summer Season, the combination of Ussur's reduced elevation and the two hills of Kwalla-Lai and Kwalla-Norai give the city its cooler climate. The hills trap moisture from air and hydrate the soil below, whilst the terrain on which the city is built is sunken, allowing for the cooler air stay trapped within the natural basin.</p><p>Autumn brings heavy rains and fog. The streets become muddy and crops that flourish in Summer and Autumn experience a lull in their usual output. The Ussurian farmers plant Autumn-specific crops to cope with the wetter conditions.</p><p>Winter is a very icy affair in Ussur. The hills of Kwalla-Lai and Kwalla-Norai become ice-capped, and the water brought by the Autumn freezes over to create a semi-permenant ground frost. Crops grow sparse during this time, and the meat of animals who can bare the cold weather become the main food source.</p><p>Spring in Ussur is notable cooler than Summer, but the same Summer crops excel in the seasonal harvest. Once the ice has thawed and the sodden ground has dried (usually taking a year or two after the end of Winter), favourable agricultural conditions return.</p><h1>Governance</h1><h2>Temple Collective</h2><p>The city is governed by the Spiritual elite of the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Temple_Collective\">Temple Collective</a> - twelve elected candiates, comprising of one leading <a href=\"#/wiki/page/High_Priestess\">High Priest or Priestess</a> (usually a Priestess) and eleven <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Ren-Luzzo\">Ren-Luzzo</a>. The Ren-Luzzo are elected officials from any of the twelve Inditt Temples, including the Alkaasuru/Ussur itself. This process brings unique perspectives and knowledge from the other cities, but also enables Ussur to hold positions of power and persuasion across the region.</p><h2>List of Notable Rulers</h2><ul><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Fresia_Vovori\">Fresia Vovori</a>: TBD - TBD</li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Barbaska_Neet\">Barbaska Neet</a> (temporary): TBD - TBD</li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Klara\"><em>Klara</em></a><em>: </em>TBD - TBD</li></ul><h1>Architecture</h1><h2>City Fortification</h2><p>Ussur is an unwalled city, but is protected by great guard towers on each of its adjacent hills, and a number of outposts, arsenals, garrisons and other fortifications throughout the city and on the roads leading towards into city.</p><h2>City Layout</h2><p>Without the presence of city walls to confine and segment the city, Ussur is open-plan in its construction.

The city is built between two great hills: the Westwards hill of Kwalla-Lai (Brother Hill) and the Eastwards hill of <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Kwalla-Norai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kwalla-Norai</a> (Sister Hill). The Ussurian province stretches in all directions from the city. In the South are the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Ussurian_Laylands\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ussurian Laylands</a>, a largely unused area which contains miles of wild <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Yugga\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yugga</a>, as well as Northward, Eastward and Westward expansions which are used for agriculture until the more fertile grounds turn into arid desert.</p><h2>Climate</h2><p>During the Summer Season, the combination of Ussur's reduced elevation and the two hills of Kwalla-Lai and Kwalla-Norai give the city its cooler climate. The hills trap moisture from air and hydrate the soil below, whilst the terrain on which the city is built is sunken, allowing for the cooler air stay trapped within the natural basin.</p><p>Autumn brings heavy rains and fog. The streets become muddy and crops that flourish in Summer and Autumn experience a lull in their usual output. The Ussurian farmers plant Autumn-specific crops to cope with the wetter conditions.</p><p>Winter is a very icy affair in Ussur. The hills of Kwalla-Lai and Kwalla-Norai become ice-capped, and the water brought by the Autumn freezes over to create a semi-permenant ground frost. Crops grow sparse during this time, and the meat of animals who can bare the cold weather become the main food source.</p><p>Spring in Ussur is notable cooler than Summer, but the same Summer crops excel in the seasonal harvest. Once the ice has thawed and the sodden ground has dried (usually taking a year or two after the end of Winter), favourable agricultural conditions return.</p><h1>Governance</h1><h2>Temple Collective</h2><p>The city is governed by the Spiritual elite of the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Temple_Collective\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Temple Collective</a> - twelve elected candiates, comprising of one leading <a href=\"#/wiki/page/High_Priestess\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">High Priest or Priestess</a> (usually a Priestess) and eleven <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Ren-Luzzo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ren-Luzzo</a>. The Ren-Luzzo are elected officials from any of the twelve Inditt Temples, including the Alkaasuru/Ussur itself. This process brings unique perspectives and knowledge from the other cities, but also enables Ussur to hold positions of power and persuasion across the region.</p><h2>List of Notable Rulers</h2><ul><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Fresia_Vovori\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fresia Vovori</a>: TBD - TBD</li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Barbaska_Neet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barbaska Neet</a> (temporary): TBD - TBD</li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Klara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Klara</em></a><em>: </em>TBD - TBD</li></ul><h1>Architecture</h1><h2>City Fortification</h2><p>Ussur is an unwalled city, but is protected by great guard towers on each of its adjacent hills, and a number of outposts, arsenals, garrisons and other fortifications throughout the city and on the roads leading towards into city.</p><h2>City Layout</h2><p>Without the presence of city walls to confine and segment the city, Ussur is open-plan in its construction.
