These Ћumans, named the INSERT NAME, built many settlements and fortresses amongst the mountains of <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Domasmï\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Domasmï</a>.</p><h2>The Age of Empires</h2><p>After the defeat in the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/The_War_of_Ruin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The War of Ruin</a>, the Domathund race had been all but eliminated. Only six remained. The remaining group fled.</p><h2>The Age of Beginnings</h2><p>An account of an encounter with the remaining Domathund, in which one was killed, was recorded in a document entitled the \"<a href=\"#/wiki/page/Account_of_the_Slaying_of_a_Dommahound\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Account of the Slaying of a Dommahound</a>\". This brought their numbers down to five.</p><h2>The Age of Awakening</h2><p>Having wandered the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Lenitä_Sands\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lenitä Sands</a> for many <a href=\"#/wiki/page/moon-year\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Moons</a>, the Doma þundfelt the presence of their creator arise from the depths and followed it to the Indit Region. During their search they were reunited with the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Aza’Dür\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aza’Dür</a>, which had also felt its creator's presence. Together they travelled first to <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Mutasaih\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mutasaih</a>, to where the lingering scent of Urünaen remained, but they found only its citizens. They killed all within the Citadel before moving on towards <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Gorjovak\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gorjovak</a>, where they joined in the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Battle_of_Darkness\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Battle of Darkness</a>. Seeing that the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Dark_Conjurer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dark Conjurer</a>, their creator's puppet, had been defeated, they fled once again. However this time they had already been reunited with Urunaün, who promises them a return to their former glory after hearing their pleas.</p><h1>Appearance</h1><p>The Domathund are an immortal species that do not age, but the health of their body is directly correlated with their dominance. During The Age of Races, when the Domathund were at their strongest, they took on a much more human form. Their skin was dark grey like sooted ash, and the colour of their eyes varied, from yellow to green to orange. Their teeth were sharp, being completely carnivorous, and have long nail-like claws.</p><p>During The Age of Beginning and The Age of Awakening, their power had depleted and their bodies began to fail, taking on a rotten appearance. Wherever they travelled they left the trace of their decay in the form of black tar-like oil. Nonetheless they remained immortal, and stronger than any mortal being.</p><h1>Governance</h1><h2>Dommaking</h2><p>The Domathund are ruled by a Domaking. The title is earned through primative dominance, and the Domaking is required to defend his position from the innevitably numerous challenges to the throne.</p><p>The Domaking sits upon a great throne named Körechä, which is bult in the shape of a cupped skeletal hand and made of innumerable charred bones. The throne is set upon a dias that, when stood upon, has a magnifying affect to make those who stand upon it seem larger than they truly are. The ancient crown is gifted to the Domaking upon his first victory - a crown made of marbled jade - and is regifted ceremonially upon each successful defending of their title.</p><p>Upon achieving the dominant status of Domaking, the Domaking will undergo a period of rapid growth, reaching up to twice the height and stature of their previous size.</p><p><br></p><h2>Notable Domakings</h2><ul><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Maltiemun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maltiemun</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Varkut\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vákut</a></li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Notable Domalords</h2><ul><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Koezut\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koefut the Merciless</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Toepoitun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toepoitun</a></li></ul><h2>Notable Domapriests</h2><ul><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Balzamut\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Balðamut the Pious</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Lofamun\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lofamun</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Kësakut\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kësakut</a></li></ul><p><br></p><h2>Notable Domaþund</h2><ul><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Loekiem_the_Wild\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Loekiem the Wild</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Fomoðka_the_Swift\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fomoðka the Swift</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Namunvut_the_Hammerhand\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Namunvut the Hammerhand</a></li></ul><h1>Culture</h1><h2>Individualistic Collectivism</h2><p>The existence of a Domathund is one of constant competition, whether it be with other races or amongst themselves. Rules are routinely overthrown, and murder is a common occurance. Domasmï had no law against murder, for it was a sign of greater power, but often it was frowned upon for, although the Domathund were fueled by greed they knew that in order for the individual to succeed the group must do too. This created a strength sense of collectivisim, where revenge was routinely sought for outsiders that killed one of their kind. Despite this, none would risk their own lives for another Domathund, and revenge took precendent over protection - even in immediate circumstances.</p><h2>Ritual Offerings</h2><p>To their creator the Domathund often prayed, seeking favours or answers. Through their worship to Urünaen they evolved various practicies to appease their creator and have their requests granted:</p><ul><li>Offer Killing: The Domathund sacrifice a non-Domaþund.</li><li>Blood Killing: The Domathund sacrifice a Domaþund.</li><li>Blood Offering: A prisoner, or Domathund, is drained of blood just before the point of death.
