Many fled the city to find safer lands within the province and various civil wars ensued. Ultimately Ukunur fell into disrepair. Its building materials were ransacked and the great fortress of <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Gor'Tantil\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gor'Tantil</a> was destroyed brick by brick.</p><h2>The Age of Uncertainty</h2><p>A large settlment grew to the West of Ukunur's ruined remains, and much of the material stolen from the city was used to build new structures in the settlement. Many of the displaced former citizens of Ukunur made there way to this new settlement, now called Ussuru (etymology uknown),</p><p>Hearing of the new settlement, <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Borna_Glorsai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Borna Glorsai</a>, a student of <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Fenraye_Huddah\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fenraye Huddah</a>'s Temple <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Altagoran\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Altagoran</a> located in modern day <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Altaglake\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Altaglake</a>, decided to build a temple at the heart of the new settlement. With only ten or so <a href=\"#/wiki/page/moon-year\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">moons</a> having passed since the publication <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Nexurkaan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nexurkaan</a> (and the subsequent overthrowing of Mant Nukko), many of the citizens of Ussuru were eager to accept the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Spirits\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Spirits</a>, and with the aid of thousands of volunteers the great Temple of <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Alkaasuru\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Alkaasuru</a> (believed to be a combination of Altagoran (Table), Kaan (People) and Ussuru, the \"Ussurian's People's Table\", or more concisely \"The Ussurian's Table\") was built at the Eastern base of the Westward hill of <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Kwalla-Lai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kwalla-Lai</a>.</p><h2>The Age of Beginnings</h2><p>The arrival of the Temple brought a great influx of settlers, who considered a sacred city - one that was free of the violence outside of its borders. This attitude ot the Spirits has largely continued through into the Age of Awakening, and Ussur's citizens remain the most Spiritual of all the Inditt Region's city populaces.</p><h1>Geography</h1><h2>Location</h2><p>Ussur is located in the South-East parts of the Inditt Region. The city is built between two great hills: the Westwards hill of Kwalla-Lai (Brother Hill) and the Eastwards hill of <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Kwalla-Norai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kwalla-Norai</a> (Sister Hill). The Ussurian province stretches in all directions from the city. In the South are the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Ussurian_Laylands\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ussurian Laylands</a>, a largely unused area which contains miles of wild <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Yugga\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yugga</a>, as well as Northward, Eastward and Westward expansions which are used for agriculture until the more fertile grounds turn into arid desert.</p><h2>Climate</h2><p>During the Summer Season, the combination of Ussur's reduced elevation and the two hills of Kwalla-Lai and Kwalla-Norai give the city its cooler climate. The hills trap moisture from air and hydrate the soil below, whilst the terrain on which the city is built is sunken, allowing for the cooler air stay trapped within the natural basin.</p><p>Autumn brings heavy rains and fog. The streets become muddy and crops that flourish in Summer and Autumn experience a lull in their usual output. The Ussurian farmers plant Autumn-specific crops to cope with the wetter conditions.</p><p>Winter is a very icy affair in Ussur. The hills of Kwalla-Lai and Kwalla-Norai become ice-capped, and the water brought by the Autumn freezes over to create a semi-permenant ground frost. Crops grow sparse during this time, and the meat of animals who can bare the cold weather become the main food source.</p><p>Spring in Ussur is notable cooler than Summer, but the same Summer crops excel in the seasonal harvest. Once the ice has thawed and the sodden ground has dried (usually taking a year or two after the end of Winter), favourable agricultural conditions return.</p><h1>Governance</h1><h2>Temple Collective</h2><p>The city is governed by the Spiritual elite of the <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Temple_Collective\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Temple Collective</a> - twelve elected candiates, comprising of one leading <a href=\"#/wiki/page/High_Priestess\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">High Priest or Priestess</a> (usually a Priestess) and eleven <a href=\"#/wiki/page/Ren-Luzzo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ren-Luzzo</a>. The Ren-Luzzo are elected officials from any of the twelve Inditt Temples, including the Alkaasuru/Ussur itself. This process brings unique perspectives and knowledge from the other cities, but also enables Ussur to hold positions of power and persuasion across the region.</p><h2>List of Notable Rulers</h2><ul><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Fresia_Vovori\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fresia Vovori</a>: TBD - TBD</li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Barbaska_Neet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barbaska Neet</a> (temporary): TBD - TBD</li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Klara\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Klara</em></a><em>: </em>TBD - TBD</li></ul><h1>Architecture</h1><h2>City Fortification</h2><p>Ussur is an unwalled city, but is protected by great guard towers on each of its adjacent hills, and a number of outposts, arsenals, garrisons and other fortifications throughout the city and on the roads leading towards into city.</p><h2>City Layout</h2><p>Without the presence of city walls to confine and segment the city, Ussur is open-plan in its construction. The Temple of Alkaasuru lies at the heart of the City, which is also the lowest point of the geographical basin, and from this central point a number of roads lead outwards. Connected between these roads are streets and allies, giving the heart of the city a web-like appearance. Towards the outer presincts of the city, streets and buildings are less orderly, leading to winding streets and disjointed buildings.</p><h2>Provincial Architecture</h2><p>Most buildings outside of the city centre are of timber construction. These include, but are not limited to, Farmhouses, Stables, Barns, Inns and Markets.</p><h2>Notable Locations</h2><ul><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Alkasuuru\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Temple of Alkasuuru</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/The_Towers_of_Kwalla-Lai_and_Kwalla-Norai\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Towers of Kwalla-Lai and Kwalla-Norai</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/Sin'quin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Sin'quin Chapel</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/The_Shrine_of_the_Fallen_Spear\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Shrine of the Fallen Spear</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/The_Golden_Market\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Golden Market</a></li><li><a href=\"#/wiki/page/The_Iron_Bells\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Iron Bells</a></li></ul><h1>Economy</h1><p>Agricultural produce is Ussur's main economy. With food and water being amongst the most lucrative products in the arid Inditt Region, Ussur continues to amass great wealth from the constant supply of both due to its unique geography and climate. This wealth has translated into secondary exports, such as fine clothing, jewellery, weapons and armour, and art.</p><h1>Military</h1><p>The Ussurian army is the largest in the Inditt Region at around 3000-5000 strong, depending on the season.</p><p><br></p><p>A city force of about 800 strong called the Ussurian Guard is used for law enforcement, as well as acting as a deployable unit in battle.</p><p>Ussur's main military force is the Bronze Shields, comprised of swordsmen and pikemen.
